# CoachAssistAI — Workout Planning Service

A small Python service that generates daily workout plans by combining:

- current weather (wind & temperature),
- configurable workout routines, and
- class rosters with attendance.

This repository includes a `demo.py` that picks a random configured class,
selects attendees from `configs/students.json`, chooses a routine from
`configs/routines.json`, fetches current weather for the class location via
Open-Meteo, and prints a weekly overview.

## Quick links

- Demo runner: `demo.py`
- Tests: `test_workout_planner.py`

## Run locally

1. Create a Python 3.10+ virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` exists):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt || pip install requests
```

3. Run the demo:

```bash
python demo.py
```

The demo uses the Open-Meteo APIs (no API key required) to fetch weather. If
you prefer to use a different weather provider, update `services/weather.py`.

## GitHub Demo Button

This repository provides a GitHub Actions workflow that can be run manually
from the Actions tab. Use the "Run workflow" button for the `Run demo` workflow
to execute the demo in a fresh environment and capture the output.

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/run-demo.yml`
- To run the demo from GitHub: open the **Actions** tab → select **Run demo** → click **Run workflow**.

When the workflow completes, the demo output is available in the workflow
logs and as a downloadable artifact named `demo-output.txt`.

## Tests

Run the integration tests locally (they may hit the Open-Meteo API; tests will
skip network-dependent checks if the API cannot be reached):

```bash
python -m unittest test_workout_planner.py -v
```

## Contributing

PRs welcome. If you add new external integrations, prefer adding environment
variable support (e.g. API keys) and update `.env.example` and documentation.
